# Front-end Test for Duggup

Front-end assignment for Kapstan
Generated Project using Vite + react-ts. Components from MUI.

---

A lot of things were rushed due to lack of time. I have also disabled tsc for build because I couldn't get to fixing the issues in time. However the app is entirely functional.
